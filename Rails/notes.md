## Notes on Rails

### Model View Controller

- Rails follows the MVC architecture
- Separation of the presentation layer and the business logic or the back-end

#### Models
- Resources in the app (users, posts, articles, stocks)
- This would usually require a database table to persist models.

#### Views
- Make up the front end of the app.
- html css and javascript
- ex: home, new, friends, etc
- Will use .erb (html with embedded ruby)

#### Controller
- Invisible to the user
- Brains behind the application
- Logic will be housed in the controllers
